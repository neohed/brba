TODO
* Add uglification etc
* move into a worker thread / webworker
* Create different systems to darken corners in shadow as well as to generate smoke.
* See what can be done with particles - make them larger and darker.
* For picking new points for splines consider a hybrid algorith where we pick the top n%
  oldest particles then do a proximity search.
